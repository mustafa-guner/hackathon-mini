# High School Web Development Hackathon

## Overview
Welcome to our **Web Development Hackathon** designed for high school students with little to no prior experience in coding! Over two workshops, you’ll create two practical web applications—a **personal portfolio** and a **dynamic to-do app**—while learning essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. By the end, you'll have built real web projects that demonstrate your coding abilities.
