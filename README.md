# High Schoolers Hackathon Schedule - Portfolio Building

### Overview
Welcome to our web development hackathon! This event is designed for high school students with no prior experience in coding. Over several sessions, participants will create a personal portfolio website, learning essential concepts in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic server-side development. By the end, everyone will have a professional-looking website and foundational coding knowledge.
